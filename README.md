TODO:
- Grab user's darkmode settings from their device & render the appropriate mode on pageload
- Click a movie to see a popup with more information about that movie
--- Look at togglePop here: https://medium.com/@daniela.sandoval/creating-a-popup-window-using-js-and-react-4c4bd125da57
--- More information on conditional rendering: https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html
--- Plan: Use a wider style of card for the popup, create a div around the individual grid cards so that when they are clicked, the popup card goes into the top, currently-displayed layer.

TODONE:
